Getting Started
==========================================
By reading this chapter, you can get an idea of the development of MOM messaging.

  .. tip::
    Example is an implementation for showing how to use the features of Nablarch and is not intended to be used to create a full-fledged application by modifying Example.
    If you want to create a full-fledged application, create it from :ref:`blank_project`.

Prerequisites
  The explanation of this chapter is based on :ref:`example_application`. 
  The operating environment of the example application must be built in advance.

  .. tip::
    The following items related to the example application are not explained in this chapter. 
    For the following items, see :ref:`example_application` .

    - Building the environment and execution of example application
    - Example application configuration
    - Information on the OSS plugin used

A description using the :ref:`example_application` is given in  :ref:`mom_messaging`  of the library, and Getting Started is not prepared because the contents are the same. 
Therefore, refer to the following description of  :ref:`mom_messaging` .

* :ref:`Sending asynchronous message <mom_system_messaging-async_message_send>`
* :ref:`Sending synchronous message <mom_system_messaging-sync_message_send>`
* :ref:`Receiving asynchronous message <mom_system_messaging-async_message_receive>`
* :ref:`Receiving synchronous message <mom_system_messaging-sync_message_receive>`
