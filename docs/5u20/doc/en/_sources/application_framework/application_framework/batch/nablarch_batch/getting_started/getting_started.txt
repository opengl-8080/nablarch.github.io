Getting Started
==========================================
By reading this chapter, you can get the basic knowledge of the development of a batch based on the Nablarch batch application architecture.

.. tip::
 Example is an sample implementation that shows how to use Nablarch's features and is not intended to be used to modify Example to create full-fledged applications.
 
 If you want to create a full-fledged application, create it from :ref:`blank_project` .

Prerequisites
  The explanation of this chapter is based on :ref:`example_application`.
  The operating environment of the example application must be built in advance.

  .. tip::
    The following items of the example application are not explained in this chapter.
    For the following items, see :ref:`example_application`.

    - Building the environment and execution of example application
    - Example application configuration
    - Information on the OSS plugin used

.. tip::
 In Nablarch batch application, since there is no difference in how to implement the application
 with :ref:`on-demand batch<nablarch_batch-on-demand_batch>` and :ref:`resident batch<nablarch_batch-resident_batch>`,
 so Getting Started is not prepared separately for each.
 The difference between :ref:`on-demand batch<nablarch_batch-on-demand_batch>`
 and :ref:`resident batch<nablarch_batch-resident_batch>` is only the handler configuration.
